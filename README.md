# Sustainable-Commute-Planner
The rapid growth of urbanization and increasing vehicular traffic have led to severe environmental and health concerns, including rising carbon emissions, air pollution, and traffic congestion. The Sustainable Commute Planner is a smart solution designed to promote eco-friendly transportation by assisting users in identifying the most sustainable and efficient routes for daily commuting. By integrating multiple modes of transport such as walking, cycling, public transit, and carpooling, the planner evaluates real-time data like traffic conditions, weather updates, and public transport schedules to recommend optimized travel options. The system aims to encourage environmentally conscious commuting behaviors while reducing travel time and energy consumption. This project not only addresses the need for sustainable urban mobility but also supports broader goals such as reducing carbon footprints and enhancing quality of life. The planner is especially beneficial in smart city environments where data-driven decision-making can significantly impact transportation efficiency and environmental sustainability.
